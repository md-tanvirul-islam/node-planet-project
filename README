## Stream in node:
Stream is a way to transfer data from one point to another point.

Stream types:
    1. Readable Streams (E.g.: Reading a file)
    2. Writeable Streams (E.g.: Writing a file)
    3. Duplex Streams (E.g.: Sockets)
    4. Transform Streams (E.g.: File compression)

Stream Pipe: Readable Stream feeds the Writable Stream.
